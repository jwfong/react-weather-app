# react-weather-app


Time took to set up Dev environment:
  45 minutes - 1hr

Time spent coding the project:
  7 - 8 hours more if considering time required to read documentation.

Decided not to use a dropdown menu for states and cities. Input fields seemed more appropriate;


Wrote tests for the 1 presentational component in the application. 
Attempted to start testing container components but ran into an issue of while trying to mock up redux store.

My approach towards testing the application would be to set up a mock store/state tree with varying values. Each component renders in direct relation to the information available in the store. 

A simpler approach could be to separate the container components into a container component and a presentaional component.
